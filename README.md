These are my dotfiles. I keep them here for my own convenience (I can easily clone them onto a VM from here, for example) but obviously anyone is welcome to use them.

_**"What's in here?"**_

## .cargo
Honestly I have no idea what this is but I remember needing it to get alacritty to work or something so into the repo it goes.

## .config
Config files for things I use or used to use. 
### Alacritty
This my fully custom alacritty theme. It uses my own color scheme and Cousine Nerd Font. It's kind of a reference for everything else on my desktop for color scheming.
### Cava
I don't use cava much but I made a config for it so into the repo it goes. It's a nice black and gradient gold.
### Fastfetch
unixporn essential
### gtk-4.0
This is a file I got from someone else (don't remember who or where) that helps to properly theme title bars in Cinnamon.
### Ulauncher
Just a user theme for Ulauncher I got from somewhere.

## .icons
I use Yaru-bark icons, so I've included that as well as the two icons it inherits (Yaru and hicolor). I've also included the DMZ-White cursor which I use. All of this is copied directly off of a Linux Mint install.

## .local/share/fonts
Just fonts. Cousine Nerd Font for monospace stuff and [Selawik](https://github.com/microsoft/Selawik) for pretty much everything else

## gawgitheme
My Cinnamon desktop theme. It's mostly derived from [Windows 10 Dark](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10-Dark) with a large amount of color changes to fit my color scheme, as well as a start menu taken from [CBlack](https://github.com/Cloweling/cblack), also with color changes.

## Vencord
Vencord is a Discord client modification. I definitely don't use this because that would be against Discord ToS which I would never violate. Theres also a custom theme included here that I made to fit my color scheme. But again I would never use it because I would never break Discord ToS.

## VSCode
My VS Code theme, also matching my desktop color scheme. I made it with [this website](https://themes.vscode.one/).

## .bashrc
This is just my bashrc. It's mostly default except for a prompt I made (~>$) and an alias for fastfetch (fetch) as well as an alias for reinstalling Vencord since thats something that someone who uses Vencord (which is not me) might have to do regularly, but again I'd like to reiterate that I myself would never use Vencord as that would violate Discord ToS which is something that I would never do because I respect Discord as a company so much.

## Wallpaper
It's a Kurzgesagt wallpaper that I hue shifted to match my desktop's color scheme.
